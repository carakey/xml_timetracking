# XML Timetracking

Tools to track time, tasks, and projects in XML, and generate Markdown reports on various time scales. Things are built to reflect my own professional context, such as the XSD enumerating my specific position description areas and the platforms that I work on. 

## Available Reports

* Weekly report `report_weekly.xsl` (in development) generates a Markdown file per week, giving a list of narratives per task for the week, nested under larger project headings where applicable. _FTE / time calculations portion needs additional work._
    * e.g. `java -jar saxon.jar -s:timetracking.xml -xsl:report_weekly.xsl monday=2022-08-15`
* Daily Report `report_daily.xsl` prints to the terminal, giving a list of task names for all tasks for the day specified.
    * e.g. `java -jar saxon.jar -s:timetracking.xml -xsl:report_daily.xsl day=2022-08-17`
* Daily OD Report `report_ODdaily.xsl` is for the Oregon Digital project's daily standup meetings. Similar to the regular daily report, but only shows tasks where the project name includes the string "OD2".
    * e.g. `java -jar saxon.jar -s:timetracking.xml -xsl:report_ODdaily.xsl day=2022-08-17`
