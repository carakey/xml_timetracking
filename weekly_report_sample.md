## Department Meeting Report

  * I attended regular OD2 Metadata Team meetings.
  * I worked on migration QA for the Pacific Northwest Stream Survey Collection, but found that the collection still needed labels fetched before proceeding.
* OD2 Metadata Remediation
  * I cleaned up problematic name URIs in the Pacific Northwest Stream Survey collection: Several Opaque Namespace URIs that were found in collection records did not exist in ONS.
* Lundeen Award Committee
  * The Lundeen Award Committee met to review a proposal, and approved funds for the project. Following the meeting, I emailed the Dean to confirm.
  * I made changes to the Lundeen Award application form based on committee discussions about special reviews.
